          <p id="history">
            <span id="gaylore">"If you've ever wondered why Provincetown is so well renown to the LGBTQ+ community,here are a few facts regarding the the beloved site.  -- In the early 1900s, artists and playwrights like Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neill found refuge in Provincetown, and their presence contributed to the town's reputation for inclusivity. Provincetown has long been a haven for artists, writers, and members of the LGBTQ+ community, particularly since the early 20th century. It became known as a sanctuary for creative expression and diversity. By the mid-20th century, it started to attract a large LGBTQ+ crowd. Its reputation as a queer-friendly destination grew after World War II, when it became a favorite spot for gay men and lesbians to visit in the summer. Provincetown was dubbed the 'Queer Summer Capital' of the U.S. by the 1950s, as LGBTQ+ individuals felt safe and free to be themselves in this picturesque coastal town. Provincetown has a long history of drag performance. Drag shows became a hallmark of the town's entertainment scene starting in the 1940s and 1950s, with many famous performers gracing the stages of local nightclubs. Well known for influencing art around the world, carnivals,  the first LGBTQ bookstore, Aids Activism, First Same Sex marriage, and first LGBTQ+ leader; Provincetown is a treasure trove of history, beauty, art and love."</span>
